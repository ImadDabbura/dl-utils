## Introduction

DL utilities is a library that utilizes `pytorch` to build common utilities
used in all DL tasks (*vision, text, tabular, etc.*) such as creating
`learner` objects that handle training/inference steps. It also has good
practives in selecting learning rates, inspecting training procedures,
parameter initialization, etc.

## Credit

The library is heavily influenced by [DL from the foundations course](https://course19.fast.ai/part2) that
fastai offered in 2019.
